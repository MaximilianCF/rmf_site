## Completed

### v0.0.3 -- Foundation

**Save/Export UX**
- Window title shows `*` when unsaved changes exist
- Exit confirmation dialog: "Save and Exit" / "Exit without Saving" / "Cancel"
- Toast notification system for save/export feedback (success/error)

**Menu System**
- Edit menu with Undo, Redo, Delete (auto-enable/disable based on state)
- File menu: New (Ctrl+N), Open (Ctrl+O), Save, Save As
- MenuItem::Separator for visual grouping
- Shortcut hints match actual keybindings

**Editing Tools**
- Snap-to-grid: `G` toggle, `Shift+G` cycle presets (0.1m to 5.0m)
- Snapping applied to anchors and model placement
- Status bar: cursor X/Y coordinates, snap state, hint keys

**SDF Export**
- Lights exported to SDF (point, spot, directional) with attenuation, color, shadows
- ROS 2 launch file (launch.py) auto-generated alongside SDF export

**Desktop Packaging**
- cargo-deb integration (.deb builds)
- AppImage build script with linuxdeploy
- CI release workflow: builds .deb + AppImage on tag push
- Linux .desktop file for application menu integration
- App icon (256x256 blueprint-style PNG)

**Code Quality**
- Replaced once_cell with std::sync::LazyLock
- Replaced panic!() with Result in rmf_site_mesh
- add_change_plugins! macro to reduce boilerplate
- WASM compilation fixed (cfg gates on desktop-only code)

### v0.0.4 -- UI Redesign

**Tabbed Properties Panel**
- Right panel reorganized from flat collapsing headers into 4 tabs
- Inspect tab (default): element properties, improved empty state
- Site tab: Levels, Scenarios, Models, Lights

- Validation warns when two locations share the same name
- Integrated into existing diagnostics panel (Validate button)

**Type-in Site ID** (P3, upstream #322)
- Search bar supports `#123` syntax to jump to entity by SiteID

**Reduce Compile Times** (P3, upstream #291, #292)
- Mold linker config added to .cargo/config.toml (commented, opt-in)

### v0.0.6 -- Editor Features & Polish

**Default Scenario Persistence** (P1, upstream #365)
- `default_scenario` field added to Site JSON format
- Save persists which scenario is the default (by SiteID)
- Load restores DefaultScenario and auto-selects it

**Snap Grid Overlay** (P2, upstream #304)
- Gizmo-based grid that matches the snap-to-grid size
- Minor/major lines + colored axis indicators (red X, green Y)
- Alt+G toggle, View menu checkbox "Snap Grid"
- Grid indicator in status bar

**Improved Error Notifications** (P3, upstream #296)
- Model loading failures shown as toast notifications with model name
- Site loading errors shown as toast
- Nav graph import shows success/error toast
- Console: "Clear" button, fixed panel ID typo

**UI Polish**
- View menu: Orthographic/Perspective items (F2/F3), Snap Grid checkbox
- Status bar: projection mode indicator, grid state, expanded shortcut hints
- Fuel asset browser: tooltips on all buttons, better empty state messages
- Keyboard: F2/F3/Delete/Debug feedback via toast notifications
- Keyboard refactored to stay within Bevy 16-param system limit

### v0.0.7 -- Preferences & Human Lanes

**User Preferences Persistence**
- Window size and last opened file saved to `~/.config/rmf_site_editor/preferences.json`
- Window restores to last used dimensions on startup
- "Open Recent" button on welcome screen when a previous file exists
- Auto-save every 30s, save on exit

**Human Lanes** (from traffic_editor)
- `LaneType` enum added to format: Robot (default), Human
- Human lanes render narrower (0.35m vs 0.5m) with orange/amber tint
- Lane type selector in inspector panel (ComboBox)
- Persisted in `.site.json`, backward-compatible (defaults to Robot)

## Planned

### P0 -- Critical / Next

**GitHub Repo Presentation**
- Repository description and topics (robotics, rmf, bevy, rust, editor)
- Social preview image for link sharing
- Add screenshots to README (editor with a loaded site)

### P1 -- High Priority / UX

**Improve Mutex Group UX** (upstream #407)
- Current mutex group editing is confusing
- Better visual feedback for group membership

### P2 -- Medium Priority / Editor Features

**Path Inspector Tool** (upstream #358)
- Visual tool to inspect and debug navigation paths

**Billboard Interactions for Locations** (upstream #381)
- Better in-world interaction for location markers

**Sub-element Hover/Select** (upstream #380)
- Hover and select individual sub-elements (e.g., door handles, wall segments)

**Zone Sketching Tool** (upstream #183)
- Draw zones/regions on the map for area-based constraints

**Saving Views** (upstream #217)
- Save camera positions and switch between named views

**Vendor Data Bridges** (upstream #193)
- Import/export vendor-specific data formats

**Remove .expect()/.unwrap()** (upstream #255)
- Systematic replacement across codebase for robustness

---

## Known Issues

- **style CI clippy**: uses `-W clippy::all` (warn only) due to remaining upstream warnings
- **ci_linux / ci_windows disabled**: only run manually via workflow_dispatch
- **No app icon in window titlebar**: Bevy window icon requires separate setup
- **Lanes on wrong levels**: upstream #395 (not yet investigated)
- **Flaky roundtrip test**: upstream #409

## Release Process

1. Commit and push to `main`
2. Create annotated tag: `git tag v0.X.Y`
3. Push tag: `git push origin v0.X.Y`
4. Release workflow builds .deb + AppImage and creates GitHub Release
5. Artifacts available at https://github.com/MaximilianCF/rmf_site/releases

## Architecture Reference

- **Engine**: Bevy 0.16 + egui (via bevy_egui 0.34)
- **Workspace**: 8 crates under `crates/`
- **Key crate**: `rmf_site_editor` (binary + lib)
- **UI system**: PanelWidget > PropertiesPanel > Tiles (WidgetSystem<Tile> trait)
- **Tabbed panel**: PanelTab component, ActivePanelTab resource, PANEL_TAB_ORDER constant
- **Menu system**: ECS-based Menu/MenuItem hierarchy with parent-child relationships
- **Format**: `.site.json` (current), `.building.yaml` (legacy import)
